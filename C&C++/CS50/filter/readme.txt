Filter is one of my excited c++ projects why using a photoshop while I could create my filter
so I invented this c++ algorithm that accepts a photo by parameter and returns depending on user specification photo ex:./filter 
(filter flag:-g,-r,-b) (directory/photo name. extension) (output. extension)
