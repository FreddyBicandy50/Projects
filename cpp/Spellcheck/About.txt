another data structure algorithm
story so I was like trying to hit a company by email 
and I faced some obstacles in writing grammar 
and for so I used third party apps like Grammarly so it cames an
idea in my mind why I don't create one too and 
here is my final product an algorithm 
base on data structure using a hash table will load a 
huge dictionary of words inside and check a given text if 
there are any misspelled words
